# Project Charter - PPE Issue Management System

## Project Name

**HFR Schafer Vervoer PPE Issue Management System**

## Background

HFR Schafer Vervoer requires a centralized health-and-safety platform to control PPE allocation, issue stock items responsibly, and collect legally defensible proof of issue through online signatures. Current manual handling introduces stock errors, weak traceability, and delayed safety compliance reporting.

## Vision

Create a secure, auditable, and easy-to-use PPE platform that supports transport, workshop, and office functions with reliable issue records and department-level accountability.

## Primary Objectives

1. Digitize worker records, PPE profiles, and issue transactions.
2. Track stock quantities by warehouse and size.
3. Support issuance with online signing through WhatsApp links.
4. Provide dashboards for admin, safety officer, storeman, and management roles.
5. Maintain complete audit logs for compliance.

## In Scope

- User registration and authentication
- Role and permission management
- People management:
  - add, edit, delete
  - assign department and sub-department
  - maintain size information
- PPE master catalog and size variants
- Stock receipts, adjustments, and low-stock alerts
- PPE issue process:
  - in-person and remote issue
  - digital signature capture
  - WhatsApp signing link delivery
- Reporting and exports
- Audit trail and data retention

## Out of Scope (Initial Release)

## Success Metrics

## Constraints and Assumptions
